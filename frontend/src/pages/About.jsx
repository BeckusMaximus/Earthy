          At Earthy, we believe that small changes in our daily routines can
          lead to a significant positive impact on our planet. Our journey began
          with a simple idea: to make it easier for everyone to lead a more
          eco-friendly life by starting with the essentials in the kitchen,
          bathroom, and selfcare.

        <h4>Our Story</h4>
        <p>
          Earthy was founded by a group of eco-conscious individuals who wanted
          to make a difference. We noticed that while many people wanted to live
          more sustainably, they often didn&#39;t know where to start. We
          decided to focus on the areas where change is most accessible and
          impactfulâ€”your kitchen, bathroom, and personal care routine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our mission is to provide high-quality, eco-friendly products that
          help you transition to a more sustainable lifestyle effortlessly. From
          biodegradable kitchenware and organic bathroom essentials to natural
          selfcare products, each item is carefully selected to reduce
          environmental impact without compromising on quality or effectiveness.
